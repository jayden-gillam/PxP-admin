## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue
There is currently a small error in the **login flow**:  
- After login, the app incorrectly routes to a `404 error` page.  
- As a temporary workaround, clicking on **Home** in the navigation will take you to the correct dashboard page.  
- We are actively working on fixing this issue.
