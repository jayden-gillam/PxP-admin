# Tech Stack

## Frontend
- **React.js** ([React Official Website](https://react.dev/))  
  We selected React.js because it allows us to build dynamic, component-based user interfaces efficiently. Its strong ecosystem and community support make it a reliable choice for developing the web-based administrative system.  

- **TypeScript** ([TypeScript Official Website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/))  
  We selected TypeScript because it provides static type checking, which helps catch errors at compile time and improves maintainability of the codebase. It integrates well with React.js and is widely used in modern web applications.  

## Backend
- **Firebase** ([Firebase Official Website](https://firebase.google.com/))  
  We selected Firebase because it provides a fully managed backend solution, including authentication, real-time database, hosting, and cloud functions. This allows the team to focus on building features instead of managing servers, and it scales automatically with user demand.  

## Version Control
- **GitHub** ([GitHub Official Website](https://github.com/))  
  We selected GitHub for version control and collaboration. It enables the team to manage source code effectively, track changes, and collaborate seamlessly.
