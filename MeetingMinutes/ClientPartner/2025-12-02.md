### Topics Discussed

1. **Iteration 2 Feature Demonstration**
   - Showed newly implemented features:
     - Custom Question Creation (with/without templates)
     - Hotkeys for faster Game Master workflow
     - UI enhancements and smoother controls
   - Client confirmed the features work and did not raise concerns.

2. **Clarification About Feature Implementation**
   - Team explained that due to football season, client could not respond to follow-up questions.
   - Matt acknowledged this and said the team’s choices were acceptable.
   - Any adjustments can be done in Iteration 3 if needed.

3. **Custom Question Improvements**
   - Client discussed potential future enhancements:
     - Ability to attach images to custom questions
     - Drag-and-drop from an image library
     - More flexible template structures for educational or children’s programming scenarios

4. **Resync Mechanism Discussion**
   - Matt asked about:
     - Whether system can detect % of players who are behind (e.g., 5–10%)
     - Triggering auto-resync based on thresholds  
   - Team agreed to explore feasibility for Iteration 3.

5. **Prediction Aid & Probability Models**
   - Client discussed an advanced feature idea:
     - A “prediction helper” that gives players probability-based suggestions (≈80% accuracy)
     - Mentioned Poisson method, probability calculators, and possibly using Google API or ChatGPT
     - A long-term enhancement idea; team will research complexity.

6. **General Feedback on System**
   - Matt expressed trust in the team’s direction.
   - Encouraged team to continue building features they believe add value.
   - No negative feedback about the current iteration’s functionality.
