# Team Meeting — Week of November 3, 2025

**Meeting start time.** 3:30 PM ET

**Meeting end time.** 04:05 PM ET

**Location/medium.** Zoom

**Present** Shristi , Jayden, Sinclair

**Minute recorder.** Shristi Khadka

### Things clarified

* Interface assignment is an *example* for one class and can be modified later to fit our project needs.
* Docker assignment due **Friday, Nov 7** (class requirement): we need a container built and the development documentation updated (`development.md`).
* For client communications, we will compile concrete, well‑scoped questions and send them to Matt and Abeed; a short meeting may follow based on their responses.
* Firebase Hosting approach: Shristi is refactoring and optimizing code paths before deployment to ensure performance (copying/modifying legacy sections where necessary).
* Rescope of Game Master features: prioritize custom questions and game creation with a draft/preview mode; deprioritize quarter notifications/visual indicators already addressed elsewhere.

### Topics discussed

* **Interface Assignment Progress:** current status, integration plan, and PR readiness.
* **Docker & Dev Docs:** containerizing services, documenting steps in `development.md`, and aligning with the Friday deliverable.
* **Client Questions:** phrasing, scope, and responsibility for sending; use an email plus a shared doc for edits.
* **Firebase Hosting & Optimization:** performance considerations, code cleanup, and rollout plan.
* **Game Master Feature Set:** custom questions, game creation workflow, preview/upcoming games list, draft mode for link testing pre‑game day.
* **Hotkeys & Video Streaming:** predefined hotkeys, previewing streams before going live, and confirming HLS behavior.
* **Testing Strategy:** what we can test now while awaiting client clarification.

### Tasks distributed

* **Sinclair** — Open a pull request for the interface; complete the **Friday Docker assignment**.
* **Shristi** — Investigate Docker for development + complete the Friday deliverable; continue Firebase Hosting work and codebase optimizations.
* **Jayden** — Look into Docker; update Discord access permissions for docs; add hotkey questions to the client‑questions doc; **send email** to Matt, Abeed, and all four team members **tonight** with the questions doc, asking for replies or a quick meeting.
* **Team** — Send client questions by **end of today**; continue exploring testing avenues while waiting for client feedback.
