## Key takeaways

- The team will be developing the Game Master and Ad Master screens for a mobile app that allows users to predict plays during live sports games
- The app is built using React Native with Firebase backend, but the new screens will likely use ReactJS on the web
- Shristi will send an email to the clients with CC to all team members and Prof. Ergin
- The team needs to schedule a meeting with the client before next Monday's deadline
- Coding will likely begin next week after the client meeting
- Dr. Ergin permission is needed before team members can be added to the main PxP repository
